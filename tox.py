        Send a file transmission request.

        Maximum filename length is TOX_MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH bytes. The filename should generally just be a file name, not
        a path with directory names.

        If a non-UINT64_MAX file size is provided, it can be used by both sides to determine the sending progress. File
        size can be set to UINT64_MAX for streaming data of unknown size.

        File transmission occurs in chunks, which are requested through the `file_chunk_request` event.

        If the file contents change during a transfer, the behaviour is unspecified in general. What will actually
        happen depends on the mode in which the file was modified and how the client determines the file size.

        - If the file size was increased
            - and sending mode was streaming (file_size = UINT64_MAX), the behaviour will be as expected.
            - and sending mode was file (file_size != UINT64_MAX), the file_chunk_request callback will receive length =
            0 when Core thinks the file transfer has finished. If the client remembers the file size as it was when
            sending the request, it will terminate the transfer normally. If the client re-reads the size, it will think
            the friend cancelled the transfer.
        - If the file size was decreased
            - and sending mode was streaming, the behaviour is as expected.
            - and sending mode was file, the callback will return 0 at the new (earlier) end-of-file, signalling to the
            friend that the transfer was cancelled.
        - If the file contents were modified
            - at a position before the current read, the two files (local and remote) will differ after the transfer
            terminates.
            - at a position after the current read, the file transfer will succeed as expected.
